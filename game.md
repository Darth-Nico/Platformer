# Title: The Unhallowed Parish

Genres: Adventure

Uncover a centuries-old parasitic entity infesting a seemingly normal medieval town using only your wits and limited tools in this pixel art horror adventure.

Players explore a large, interconnected medieval town from a top-down perspective, solving logic and physics-based puzzles to progress.  The core loop involves investigating locations, finding clues (hidden objects, environmental storytelling), and using found items to solve puzzles that reveal the parasitic entity's influence and its horrific nature.  Puzzles might involve manipulating objects to activate mechanisms or decipher cryptic clues left behind by past victims, drawing on classic adventure game tropes. The town itself is the central puzzle, with hidden areas and branching narratives dependent on the player's puzzle-solving choices.  The narrative unfolds through environmental storytelling, document analysis, and interactions with few surviving townsfolk, hinting at the insidious horror unfolding.

The game explores themes of paranoia, isolation, and the terrifying unknown within seemingly normal environments.  The medieval setting enhances the unsettling atmosphere, juxtaposing familiar medieval tropes with unsettling, otherworldly horror, as the player fights against a parasitic entity subtly warping the world around them. The survival aspect emphasizes resourcefulness and smart usage of found objects, creating a sense of vulnerability against a greater, parasitic foe.

# Mechanics

Herbal Remedies

The player can collect and combine different herbs and ingredients found throughout the town to create remedies that provide temporary benefits, such as increased speed, enhanced perception to reveal hidden clues, or improved resistance to the parasitic entity's influence.  These remedies are crafted using a simple interface, adding a resource management aspect and strategic choices to the gameplay.  Recipes are discovered through exploration and deciphering cryptic notes.  The effects are time-limited, adding a layer of urgency and requiring players to manage their inventory strategically.

Light Manipulation

Certain puzzles and areas require the player to manipulate the town's environment by altering light sources or creating shadows to progress.  Using a combination of found objects (mirrors, lanterns, etc.) and the environment itself, players can solve these light-based puzzles by directing light beams, creating illusions, or using shadows to activate mechanisms or reveal hidden paths.  This mechanic is tied to the game's setting, creating puzzles consistent with the medieval theme.

Environmental Anomalies

The parasitic entity's influence manifests as subtle environmental changes, like flickering lights, shifting shadows, or unusual sounds.  By closely observing these environmental anomalies, the player can deduce clues about the entity's presence, the location of hidden areas, and the progression of the parasitic infestation.  These changes create dynamic puzzle elements and deepen the game's horror aspects, rewarding attentive observation and environmental storytelling.

# Objectives

Weaken the parasitic entity by systematically purifying the seven ritual sites throughout the town.  Each site requires solving unique environmental puzzles to disrupt the entity's influence. Once all sites are purified, the entity will be vulnerable to a final confrontation, triggering the true ending. The purification process involves using light manipulation and herbal remedies, culminating in a final ritual to banish the entity.

# Rules

Dynamic Parasitic Influence

The parasitic entity's influence intensifies based on the player's actions and time spent in affected areas.  Increased influence manifests as more frequent and severe environmental anomalies, tougher puzzles, and the appearance of hostile entities. This creates a sense of urgency and risk/reward when exploring.  Purifying ritual sites reduces the entity's influence, lessening the environmental hazards and puzzle difficulty in those areas.

# Strategy

Prioritize exploring the town meticulously, searching for hidden clues and environmental anomalies. This reveals herb locations for remedies and hints towards puzzle solutions, reducing overall challenge. Early puzzle-solving focuses on light manipulation, creating easier access to areas. The acquired resources are then used to tackle increasingly difficult environmental puzzles at the ritual sites.
